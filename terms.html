          <p>
            Paramount Web offers a free multiple revision facility on all
            website &amp; marketing packages. Any customer, who approves the
            initial website draft, automatically gets entitled to the 100%

            improving the website and adding all the pages and content until
            completion. Customers may contact us via email or phone to make
            these changes. As soon as the setup fee has been paid, we will
            contact the customer and provide a free consultation as well as
            assistance in choosing a domain name. We guarantee based on the
            information provided by the customer that the website will be up and
            running within 5 days from the sign up date and revision can take
            1-3 days. Once the website is completed, we will submit it to all
            major search engines and make all the necessary tweaking to make
            sure the website is found based on the customers' geographical
            market. The setup fee must be paid in order to begin any website
            project, monthly service plans begin 30 days following the setup
            fee. There is a 1 year contract on all monthly website &amp;

            30 days prior to the end of the contract, not doing so will
            automatically renew the agreement for an additional year. If the
            customer defaults on the payments, the website will be suspended
            within the following 30 days until payment has been made for the
            balance owed.

            as well as the hosting associated to the domain for the purpose of
            online promotional activities for the term of the contract.
